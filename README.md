# Ansible Collection - imp1sh.ansible_openwrt
This is an Ansible collection for OpenWrt devices. It will only work if you have enough flash space available to install python which is reuired. Typically old devices won't qualify.
It's being tested with virtualized x86 OpenWrt instances that obviously don't suffer from this problem.
